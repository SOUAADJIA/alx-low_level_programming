## Description

This project is about understanding and implementing search algorithms in C programming language. Specifically, it covers the concepts of linear search and binary search algorithms. This project is a part of the curriculum of Holberton School.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc
- Compile your code with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` flags
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the `printf` function of the standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `search_algos.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

### More Info
You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
…
